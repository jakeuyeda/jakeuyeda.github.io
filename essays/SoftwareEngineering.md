Software Engineering is defined as a process of analyzing user requirements and then designing, building, and testing software applications which will satisfy those requirements. (Guru99, Website) When I read this definition, I see many skills I need to develop to be a proficient software engineer. In this piece I will tell you what got me interested in software engineering and what I think is the best skill to know for becoming a proficient software engineer.

## Why I am interested in Software Engineering

My interests in software engineering comes from video games and apps. For as long as I could remember, I was interested in how they made video games since it was the thing I was interested in when I was growing up. When I started learning more and more about technology as I grew older, I was intrigued about the possibility to make software. The first language I learned was Java. After learning the syntax and how to think of an algorithm, the first thing I created was a rock, paper, scissors game against the computer. Having the satisfaction in creating something got me hooked. This is why I am very interested in computer engineering.

## An Important Skill for a Software Engineer

You will need a lot of skills to become a proficient software engineer, but what I think is the most valuable skill is the ability to learn new things fast. In this type of industry, new things are being created everyday. Whether that being a more proficient algorithm that can make your software run faster or a new type of coding language you will need to learn. You will need to learn everything quickly so you do not stay behind the times. This is very important because there are many people who are willing to learn to get a better job to earn more money. These competitors will stop you from getting a good paying job. You do not need to know everything about being a software engineer, but you will need to have the attitude to want to learn more. This is why I think that the ability to learn new things fast is an important skill to have if you want to be a proficient software engineer.
