According to Oracle, "The UI Framework is the set of classes and interfaces that define the elements and behavior of a window-based UI Subsystem. It defines a structure for defining user interfaces." This means that it will be easier to format your website when coding in HTML. This makes it easier because you can use classes to make grids, icons, menus, etc. Without using UI Frameworks, it is very hard to make these things on your website.


## Advantage in using UI Frameworks

The biggest advantage is that it can make your life way easier. For example, when trying to make a menu, it is way easier to make it using a UI framework where it is only one line of code. If you do not use an UI Framework, it would take a couple lines of code in your stylesheet to make it look nice. When using UI Framework it is easier to put elements in places you want them. Another advantage is that it makes bigger projects and group work easier. Since you already know the framework you will be using, there will hardly be any disagreements when trying to design your website. Without a framework, everyone doing the project will have to decide the little details and that will take up time. These are the two biggest advantages I see when using frameworks.

## My Experiences

When I was making a website without using any frameworks, I realised how hard it is to format your website to make it look more modern. I found it very hard to make things like putting words into columns. You would need to keep adjusting the margins and things like that to make the website look nice. When using the UI Frameworks, I found it very easy to make columns because there is a class called grids, where you can make columns for different things on your website. The hardest part in learning UI Framework is reading it. When looking at the code, I found it very hard to read it. The reason behind this may be because I don't know the coding standards for this but when looking at the code, it looked cluttered. But with practice, I found it easier and easier to read it.
