Javascript is a very interesting language. I have learned Java prior to learning Javascript so learning Javascript was much easier. When learning Javascipt I have realized that there are a lot of similarities and differences between Java. 
When I was doing exercises on <https://www.freecodecamp.org/>, the first thing I noticed was that Javascript is a weakly type language that has more relaxed syntax. When I say a weakly type language, I mean that you do not have to declare the type when making a variable. For example, in Java if you wanted to declare a number or word, you could not use the same type. You would have to use <int> for a number and <string> for a word. Using javascript, all you need to use is <let>.<let> will allow you to declare a number and a string. Another main difference is that in Javascript, you do not need to declare the return type. You can return a number and a word in the same function. In Java you would need to declare the return type in the beginning of the function. If you don't, you will get a syntax error. These were the main differences that I noticed when learning Jacascript.
