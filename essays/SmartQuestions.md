Let me start this off by asking, "What is a smart question?" Before I knew the answer to this sort of question, I thought a smart question is a question that helps you understand something. But according to this website: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html, There is a lot in asking a smart question.

## Important things into asking a Smart Question

When you have a question on a topic, you have to make sure you are asking someone that knows the answer or can help you understand how to get to the right answer. If you ask a biology teacher a question about how to make a website, you do not know if that teacher knows the answer or not. The only thing you know is that the teacher understands biology really well. It would not be a smart decision to ask the biology teacher on how to make a website. You also have to make sure that the question has never been asked before. With technology being advanced as it is StackOverFlow is a good website to ask questions about computer science. Many people use StackOverflow if they have a question. When you, yourself have a question, make sure it is not already answered on the internet. I will now go over some questions on StackOverflow to see whether they are smart or not so smart questions.

## Smart way to ask a Question

The question asked on the website above is a smart way to ask a question. The question he asked was relevant to StackOverflow, where questions about computer science are answered. When asking his question, he put all the code necessary to analyze and also gave his experience when coming up with the problem he had. He also put his thought into the question so the person that answered his question can explain the answer in terms he can understand. This is why I thought this question was a smart way to ask a question.

## Not so Smart way to ask a Question

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31117132/why-cant-we-declare-variables-in-if-statement

The question asked on the website above is not a smart way to ask a question. In this situation, this person already knew that there were questions that were very similar to his on the site. He is also asking a question on why something doesn't exist. In the question he is asking why he can't declare variables in an if statement. The comments below say it's because the language does not support it. This is one example I found on how to ask a not so smart question.
