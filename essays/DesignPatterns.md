## What A Design Pattern is

Have you been using a Design Pattern? "Design patterns are commonly defined as time-tested solutions to recurring design problems." [(Maiorriello)](https://www.developer.com/design/article.php/1474561/What-Are-Design-Patterns-and-Do-I-Need-Them.htm) These design problems are issues that are not solved that developers need to take into consideration. For example, a design problem may be to design a way for families to connect during COVID-19. Another design problem may be to design a way for people to figure out the best places to eat in the city. These design problems can be solved using design patterns because they both can be made using an application. A design pattern they both have can be a structural one where both these applications have the same structure. This may mean that the pages and components can be made the same way. Where the application can look similar but have different contents. These design patterns can be used because they are tested through time. This means that these design patterns can be used throughout your life as a developer. This makes it so that you can be faster when solving these design problems.

## Learning how to use Design Patterns

Before I heard what a design pattern was, I was using it. Even though I did not know what a design pattern was, I was using it to solve different problems when I was learning how to make an application. I was using the same template to build different applications. This made it easy for me since I was using the same template over and over again. The hardest part in all of this was trying to figure out how the template worked. I had to figure out how the application gets built using the template. When I figured that out, it was much easier using this design pattern to solve different design problems.

## The Benefits

I think that the best benefit in using design patterns is the amount of time you save. When using a design pattern you save a lot of time because you would have used it before on a different design problem. If you do not use a design pattern, then you will have to keep brainstorming ways to solve a design problem when coming up with different problems. When using a design pattern you save a lot of time when you are brainstorming since you already have a general solution to the problem, all you have to do is tweak some details. This is just like adding numbers. In the beginning you have to figure out how addition works. When you figure that out you can solve any type of addition problem later after tweaking the numbers. With example above all I had to tweak was the template to get my desired outcome.
