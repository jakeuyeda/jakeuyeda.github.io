## What A Design Pattern is

"Design patterns are commonly defined as time-tested solutions to recurring design problems."[(Maiorriello)](https://www.developer.com/design/article.php/1474561/What-Are-Design-Patterns-and-Do-I-Need-Them.htm) These design problems are issues that are not solved that developers need to take into consideration. For example, a design problem may be to design a way for families to connect during COVID-19. Another design problem may be to design a way for people to figure out the best places to eat in the city. These design problems can be solved using design patterns becasue they both can be made using an application. A design pattern they both have can be a structural one where both these applications have the same structure. This may mean that the pages and componets can be made the same way. Where the application can look similar but have different contents. These design patterns can be used becasue they are tested through time. This means that these design patterens can be used throughout your life as a developer. This makes it so that you can be faster when solving these design problems.

## When I was using Design Patterns

Before I heard what a design pattern was, I was using it. Even though I did not know what a design pattern was, Iwas using it to solve different problems when I was learning how to make an application.
