Javascript is a very interesting language. I have learned Java prior to learning Javascript so learning Javascript was much easier. When learning Javascript I have realized that there are a lot of similarities and differences between Java. 

## Differences between Java and Javascript

When I was doing exercises on <https://www.freecodecamp.org/>, the first thing I noticed was that Javascript is a weak type language that has a more relaxed syntax. When I say a weak type language, I mean that you do not have to declare the type when making a variable. For example, in Java if you wanted to declare a number or word, you could not use the same type. You would have to use <int> for a number and <string> for a word. Using javascript, all you need to use is "let". "Let" will allow you to declare a number and a string. Another main difference is that in Javascript, you do not need to declare the return type. You can return a number and a word in the same function. In Java you would need to declare the return type in the beginning of the function. If you don't, you will get a syntax error. These were the main differences that I noticed when learning Javascript.

## Similarities between Java and Javascript

The syntax between the two are very similar. When making loops, and using if statements, the syntax is the exact same. You could copy code from Java and paste it for Javascript. You would just need to change a little bit of the code to make it to work. That is how similar the syntax is to each other.

## Overall Thoughts

Javascript is a language that is pretty easy to learn if you already have programming experience. I liked how it was a weak type language so I didn't have to worry about the different types when coding. When doing the exercises and doing WODs, I looked back to my prior experiences in Java to write the code. The exercises helped me learn the language of Javascript so I am more comfortable.
