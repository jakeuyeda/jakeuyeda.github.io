summary: Mana FC is a soccer team in which I was a team captain.
---

Mana FC was a soccer team in which I was a team captain. I was on this team 2014-2017 with some of my friends. We played in the league called HYSA (Hawaii Youth Soccer Association). We had practice twice a week and at least one game every weekend. Most of my teammates were younger than me so I had to be someone who could be relied on.

For this team, I was a team captain who was responsible for encouraging my teammates, being a role model, and relaying my coaches orders. Being on this team taught me a lot of things. It taught me how to be a leader and how to work in a team. When being a leader I learned that you had to be a good role model. You could not just tell a person to do something if you are not doing it too. That would make them think bad of you, and in the future may not even listen to you.

Before I was a team captain for Mana FC, I thought it was to be a leader. I thought you just had to tell people what to do when you are in a certain situation. But, when I came I became a team captain, I didn't realize all the new skills required to become a good leader. Some of the skills that I found was required along the way was to be vocal and listen to your fellow teammates. When being a leader, I realized that you do not to be perfect. You can listen to your fellow teammates advice if you are not sure what to do. This is what I found out when becoming a team captain for Mana FC.
