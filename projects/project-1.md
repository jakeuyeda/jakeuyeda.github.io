summary: Mana FC is a soccer team in which I was a team captain.
---

Mana FC was a soccer team in which I was a team captain. I was on this team 2014-2017 with some of my friends. We played in the league called HYSA (Hawaii Youth Soccer Association). We had practice twice a week and at least one game every weekend. Most of my teammates were younger than me so I had to be someone who could be relied on.

For this team, I was a team captain who was responsible for encouraging my teammates, being a role model, and relaying my coaches orders. Being on this team taught me a lot of things. It taught me how to be a leader and how to work in a team. When being a leader I learned that you had to be a good role model. You could not just tell a person to do something if you are not doing it too. That would make them think bad of you, and in the future may not even listen to you.


You can learn more about HYSA at the [HYSA Website](https://www.hawaiisoccer.com/about-hysa/). This is where we got into tounaments and played our season.
